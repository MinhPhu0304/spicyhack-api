# Spicyhack API 

This is a project built based on the other [Architecture slot machine](https://github.com/MinhPhu0304/architecture-slotmachine)

The other project is the front of it. I wanted to try out Golang so I made this to learn more about Golang

## Getting started

- Install [Golang](https://golang.org/doc/install)
- Clone the Repo
- Run ```go install spicyhack``` to fetch all depencies
- Run ```go run main.go```
- Go to web browser or [Postman](https://www.postman.com) then enter url ```localhost:3000```
- DONE!!!!!!!!!

## Features
 - [x] Super fast ~ 149 **micro** second
 - [x] Easy to understand (for now)
 - [ ] Cloudformation to deploy service to AWS (WIP)
